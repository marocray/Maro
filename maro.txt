Congratulations!
It’s me a Maro … a perpetually anxious 24-year-old living in Hyde Park, Chicago. I spend most of my time at school doing research. I also write silly stories featuring copyrighted characters doing gay shit. I'm moved by the geology and geochemistry of Illinois’ landscape and the history that has been made on it. Find me on this website as I update it to feature more of my work.
